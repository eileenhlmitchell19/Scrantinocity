        <ul>

        <p>
            The bands main singer, songwriter and drummer is Dunder Mifflins one and only Kevin Malone. By day, he works in accounting in a mid sized paper company with an m&m jar by his side, pies on the mind and occassionally home made chilly oozing on the floor. By night, he works the band room, rippin the guitar, killin those vocals and stickin it to da maahn.

        <p>If you have not yet seen Scrantinocity live, they come highly recommended by the Vances(Bob Vance, Vance Refridgeration), and of course the offices one and only Michael Gary Scott. </p>
        <p>Scrantinocity holds a very limited number of shows, as Kevin is pretty well booked between the band as well as his side hustle in another band, Kevin and the Zits, as well as some of his own solo performances.</p>
        <p>If you have not been graced with the glory that is this band, content teasers can be found below. Prepare to have your mind blown as you dive into the vocal majesty of Mr. Malone at a solo performance, as well as a short documentary that further explains the band, again by none other than Mr. Malone himself. </p>
